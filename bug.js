This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. It is a common error in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when working with deeply nested objects.  For example:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser();
  }, []);

  const fetchUser = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some_api_endpoint');
    const data = await response.json();
    setUser(data);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

If the `fetchUser` function hasn't completed yet, `user` will be `null`, causing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` when the component renders.  Similar errors may occur with deeply nested objects where an intermediate object is null or undefined.
